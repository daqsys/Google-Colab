# Google Colab Notebooks
### Folder YOLOv3 - Train Tiny YOLO
#### Description
The yolo notebook here is self explanation.  It will download and build darknet with GPU support for fast training.
It starts demonstrating how to setup compile yolo in a linux machine and validate the detection with default figures.
Next we will use OpenImages Dataset to train yolov3-tiny and finally test the trained network.  
This network finally you could use it on an embedded device (cell phone, raspberry pi or any embedded linux system)
